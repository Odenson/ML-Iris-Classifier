# ML-Iris-Classifier
A Machine Learning Iris Classifier test

Will use the following pattern to achieve ML in this project

1. Load data for ML
2. Create teaching data set
3. Analise the data graphically
4. Test different models to find best "FIT"
5. Create Iris-classifiier-model based of best model above
